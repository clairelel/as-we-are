      <h3>A Book For Every Moon</h3>
      <p>aka the books that have shaped my perspectives on life and changed my mind. </p>
      <p>From purely cathartic books which make you bawl and purge out all the emotions you can muster, to educational reads that teaches you (or at least me) to see things in a new or different light! This is my own curation of books that have resonated with me and my takes on them.</p>
   <p> 1. For One More Day by Mitch Albom
  <p></p>  Love, reconciliation and forgiveness are the key values that I took away from the novel. Through the protagonist, Chick who had a ‘fortunate’ extra day with his deceased mother, it showed the unwavering love and tenderness and parent has for their child, even when manifested in unpleasant ways to the receiver, it was echoed in his own (broken) relationship with his daughter which was both heartwarming and heart wrenching. Ultimately, Albom showed me what family meant to him and in the same way, helped me love my family more as well, even when I find them intolerable.</p>
    <p>2. And The Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini 
    </p>‘Cruelty and benevolence are but shades of the same colour’ was a quote that stuck with me throughout the novel and showed me that life is not just black and white but a whole spectrum of colours in between. This novel revolves around the separation of a family and showed me that not everything is as it seems, challenging conventional beliefs and thinking, showing how it had both beneficial and detrimental impacts. Perhaps this novel would help you appreciate your family more.
    <p></p> 3. The Unbearable Lightness Of Being by Milan Kundera 
    </p>At the core of it, the book is a romance novel of guy meets girl and the complications that they face but ultimately overcome. What sets it apart is the rumination of the author himself as he slips in and out of the characters, his poignant and philosophical views towards life and more importantly love. It brilliantly captured the political climate of the period of the Prague Spring and the de-sovietisation of Eastern European states and showing the repercussions on the people (the macrocosmic and microcosmic shifts) , how it affected their daily lives in the most captivating ways that keeps u on the hook yet left reeling. 
    This book made me feel a lot and think a lot about while reevaluating my own philosophy towards love and life! 
    <p> </p>4. The Memoirs Of A Geisha by Arthur Golden
    <p></p>This historical fiction novel stuck with me through the years as it showed me how cruel humans can be even when we’re trying to be kind as well as how history affects us all differently. It showed the inherent need for some men to have control over a woman but women themselves not helping each other but trying to jeopardise others; as if there’s this internalised misogyny that is ingrained/programmed in us, which still rings true today! However, it was haunting and empowering, to see the character, Chiyo grow and develop into an elegant women, despite her harsh and oppressive circumstances. Her perseverance and kindness made her an easily adored protagonist. More than that, the book showed me that everybody has their own truths and we are in charge of our own narratives- we are what we make our lives to be. 
<p></p> 5. The Vegetarian by Han Kang 
<p></p>The entire novel was illusive and insidious, exploring the deep and dark recesses of the human mind, illuminating the impacts of mental illness in a evocative and perturbing light. It’s definitely not for the faint hearted, with the graphic imagery and the impulsivity of the character that act on their most carnal instincts (when they loose control of their minds). It’s eerie, the way in which the minds of the characters slowly disintegrate and their capitulation to their own desires, demonstrating a lack of control, evokes sympathy in the reader as well as serving as a reminder for self-introspection. The inconclusive and unresolved feeling left at the end of the novel is chilling and sends shivers down your spine.
<p></p>6. Sapiens by Noah Yuval Harari 
<p></p>This book put things in perspective of how briefly we’ve walked this earth and the paradigm shifts that we’ve caused. It’s humbling yet empowering to see what we are capable of but the sobering reminder of our hubris and the potential downfall of our kind.Educational and riveting, the book is an eye opener and makes you think deeper and wider, challenging you to see things as they are, even when they aren’t pleasant- it compels you (or at least me) to want to lead a better life. While I may not fully agree with all his arguments and the nihilistic quality that influences certain issues discussed in the book, it is worth the read, so as to not live in ignorance and just consume things which reinstate and validate your own values/beliefs! 
<p></p>7. Man searching for meaning by Viktor E Frankl
<p></p>Nietzsche once said that as long as you have a why you live, you can survive almost any how. The didactic style employed by Frankl teaches the reader how to live a life with meaning without prescribing a definition for a meaningful life. To see the value that each person holds that goes beyond superficialities (i.e usefulness) and the unending potential that one bares, that is innate. Following Sapiens, the book acts as an advisory to not just lead a more meaningful life, but a better life that transcends one’s circumstance.
